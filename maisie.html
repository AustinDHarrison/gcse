<marquee>It is a truth universally acknowledged that everyone has that one person who seems to exist solely to test the boundaries of patience, serenity, and emotional resilience. For me, that person is Maisie Heaselgrave. Some people wake up in the morning and think, “Today, I will be productive.” Maisie wakes up and thinks, “How can I irritate [your name] in new, creative, and emotionally exhausting ways?”  Maisie possesses a unique talent for locating precisely what will annoy me the most, and then committing to it with the determination of an Olympic athlete. If being annoying were a competitive sport, Maisie would not only take home the gold medal — she’d frame it and hang it in my room just to remind me of her victory daily.  Let’s begin with her voice. It’s not just the pitch — it’s the way she says things. Sarcasm drips from every word like syrup off a badly made pancake. Every sentence is laced with a passive-aggressive undertone that makes me wonder if she’s subtly trying to ruin my day or just doing it instinctively.  Then there’s her timing. If there’s ever a moment where peace, quiet, or concentration is needed, Maisie will magically appear — loud, chaotic, and armed with the most pointless question imaginable. “Do you think squirrels ever get bored?” she’ll ask in the middle of a serious conversation or right when I’m trying to focus. It’s impressive, really — like she has a sixth sense for the worst possible moments.  What’s most infuriating is that she does it all with a smile. Not an apologetic, sheepish smile, but a smug, victorious one — the smile of someone who knows exactly what they’re doing and is proud of it. The kind of smile that says, “Yes, I am annoying you, and yes, I am enjoying it.”  But despite all of this — or perhaps because of it — Maisie is unforgettable. Her presence is like glitter: no matter how hard you try to get rid of it, it lingers. And maybe, just maybe, beneath all the chaos and torment, there’s a twisted kind of admiration. Because it takes real skill to be that annoying — and Maisie Heaselgrave is nothing if not skilled.</marquee>
